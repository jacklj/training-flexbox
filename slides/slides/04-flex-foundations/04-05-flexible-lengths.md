## Flexible lengths

Defining aspect of flexbox layout: the ability to make various lengths of the flexbox items flexible -  to distribute either positive or negative available free space amongst them, relative to their growth/shrink factors

- width
- height
- padding
- margin

Note:
- if positive_free_space -> distribute space amongst flexible lengths that can grow, proportional to their growth factors.
- if negatve_free_space -> shrink flexible lengths that can shrink, proportional to their shrink factors.
