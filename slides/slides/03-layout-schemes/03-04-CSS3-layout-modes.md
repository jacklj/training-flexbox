## CSS3 layout modes

CSS3 introduced two more: *grid layout* (for another time), and *flex layout*

_My goal in doing Flexbox and later Grid was to replace all the crazy float/table/inline-block/etc hacks that Iâ€™d had to master as a webdev. All that crap was (a) stupid, (b) hard to remember, and (c) limited in a million annoying ways, so I wanted to make a few well-done layout modules that solved the same problems in simple, easy-to-use, and complete ways._

Note:
- Motivation behind these new modes: created explicitly to replace float and table layout hacks.
- makes common design patterns very easy, as flexbox:
    - is Direction agnostic
    - distributes Space around components very easy
    - makes reordering components easily - great for responsive design
