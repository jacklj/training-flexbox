## Flex grow and shrink
```css
flex-grow: <positive number> /*default: 0*/
flex-shrink: <positive number> /*default: 1*/
```

- Specifies how much the flex item will grow (the flex grow factor), or shrink (the flex shrink factor), relative to its sibling flex items, when the flex containerâ€™s positive or negative free space is distributed among them.


Note:
- unitless value
- e.g. a flex item with flex shrink factor 3 will shrink three times faster than a sibling flex item with shrink factor 1. Both might have the same minimum length.

Demo:
- add flex-grow: 1 to one flex item (default: 0)
- add to a few others, also other values (including non-integer)
  - e.g. a single item having flex-grow: 0.5 means it takes half the available positive space
