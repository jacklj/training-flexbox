## Flex property shorthand

```css
flex: <flex-grow> <flex-shrink> <flex-basis>; /*default 0 auto*/
```

#### Common values:

- ```flex: 0 auto``` - grow: 0, shrink: 1, basis: auto
- ```flex: auto``` - grow: 1, shrink: 1, basis: auto
- ```flex: none``` - grow: 0, shrink: 0, basis: auto
- ```flex: <positive number x>``` - grow: x, shrink: 1, basis: 0

Note:
- The flex property is a shorthand for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and the flex-basis properties.

```flex: 0 auto```
- default value: grow: 0, shrink: 1, basis: auto
- Item is sized based on its width and height properties, or content if width/height not set
- Cant grow, but can shrink (to its minimum)
- Alignment abilities or auto margins can be used to align items along main axis
- revisit original flexbox demo

```flex: auto```
- grow: 1, shrink: 1, basis: auto
- Item is sized based on width/height properties, but is also fully flexible (grow and shrink)

```flex: none```
- grow: 0, shrink: 0, basis: auto
- Sized based on width/height, but fully inflexible

```flex: <positive number>```
- grow: <number>, shrink: 1, basis: 0
- Flexible and flex basis 0 => item receives the specified proportion of the remaining space
- very common
