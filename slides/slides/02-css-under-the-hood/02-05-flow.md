## Flow:

What does it mean when elements are taken out of "flow"?

When boxes are layed out *independently* of their elements' positions/relationships in the document tree.

E.g. With an absolutely positioned element, the element may be placed anywhere within the visual medium, not  respecting its location and relationships in the document tree.
