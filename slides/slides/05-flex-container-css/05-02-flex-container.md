## Flex container
```css
display: flex | inline-flex;
```

- makes an element a flex container
- All the immediate children of the flex container automatically become flex items
- ```display: flex``` makes a box whose outer behaviour is block, and inner is a flex container
- ```display: inline-flex``` the outer behaviour is inline

Note:
Demo
- start with block parent, block children
- make parent a flex container and children flex items by adding display: flex to container
