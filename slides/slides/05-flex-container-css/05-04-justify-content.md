## Justify content

```css
justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;
```

- specifies how flex items are laid out along the main axis, i.e. how is free space distributed?

Note:
1. flex-start (default)
2. flex-end
3. center
4. space-between (items are evenly distributed along the line; first item touching the start, last item touching the end)
5. space-around (equal space between all flex items)
